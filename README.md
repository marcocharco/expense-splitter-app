## Features
- Create groups to share expenses with the same circle of people
- Split expenses equally, by percentage, by fraction, or with custom dollar values
- Record grocery receipts as a single expense with different splits for each item
- Quickly see how much you owe to the group or are owed by the group
- View all group activity with time stamps and activity details
- Group expenses into settlements to minimize the number of payments needed


## Why?
The existing spreadsheet I used with my roommates eventually became complicated to use and we wanted a simpler way to track shared expenses and payments. All of the features in the app were either inspired by our original spreadsheet or were features we wanted but didn't have in our spreadsheet.
